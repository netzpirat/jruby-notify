# JNotify for JRuby [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vongruenigen/jruby-notify.png)](https://travis-ci.org/vongruenigen/jruby-notify)

jruby-notify is a thin wrapper around the [JNotify](http://jnotify.sourceforge.net/) library, a java library that allow
java application to listen to file system events, such as:

* File created
* File modified
* File renamed
* File deleted

## Supported platforms

The gem is written for JRuby and uses the JNotify library that supports the following platforms:

* Windows (2000 or newer)
* Linux with INofity support (2.6.14 or newer)
* Mac OS X (10.5 or newer)

Please have a look at the platform specific notes on the [JNotify](http://jnotify.sourceforge.net/) page.

## Installation

    gem install jruby-notify

## Example

    require 'jruby-notify'

    notify = JRubyNotify::Notify.new
    notify.watch Dir.pwd do |path, file|
      puts "Detected change in: #{ File.join(path, file) }"
    end

    notify.run

## Forecast

With the upcoming release of Java 7 there will be a more robust solution to this problem with the
[WatchService API](http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/nio/#6). This gem will
make use of this API when it'll be released.

## Other solutions

There are other gems that provides almost the same functionality for MRI:

* [rb-fsevent](https://github.com/thibaudgg/rb-fsevent) for Mac OS X only
* [rb-inotify](https://github.com/nex3/rb-inotify) for Linux only
